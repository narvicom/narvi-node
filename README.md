# Narvi API Documentation

Welcome to the Narvi API documentation! This guide provides detailed information on using the Narvi API, which follows
REST principles for ease of integration. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

## API Basics

- **Resource-Oriented URLs**: The Narvi API uses resource-oriented URLs to structure endpoints.
- **JSON Request and Response**: You can send JSON-encoded request bodies and expect JSON-encoded responses.
- **Standard HTTP Codes**: Narvi utilizes standard HTTP response codes for indicating success or failure.
- **Authentication**: Authentication is handled using API keys and private keys.

## Object Updates

Please note that the Narvi API does not support bulk updates. Each API request is designed to work on only one object at
a time.

## Installing Our Node Application

To get started with our Node.js application, you can run the following command to install it:

```bash
npm install --save narvi
```

## Authentication

Authentication for the Narvi API is crucial for security. We use API keys and private keys to verify requests. To manage
your API keys, visit our web application
at [my.narvi.com/settings/overview/api](https://my.narvi.com/settings/overview/api)

Remember, your API keys grant significant privileges, so keep them secure! Avoid sharing your secret API keys in
publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code.

To authenticate using our Node.js library, use the following code snippet:

```javascript
const Narvi = require('narvi');
const narvi = Narvi({
  apiKeyId: 'XXXXXXXX',
  privateKeyFilePath: './narvi_private.pem',
});
```

## Error Handling

Narvi employs conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here's a general
breakdown:

- Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
- Codes in the 4xx range signify an error resulting from the provided information (e.g., missing required parameters,
  charge failure, etc.).
- Codes in the 5xx range denote server errors, although these are rare.

Here are some specific error codes and their meanings:

- **200 - OK**: Everything worked as expected.
- **400 - Bad Request**: The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
- **401 - Unauthorized**: No valid API key or private key provided, which caused the request to have a bad signature.
- **402 - Request Failed**: The parameters were valid, but the request failed.
- **403 - Forbidden**: The API key lacks permissions to perform the request.
- **404 - Not Found**: The requested resource doesn't exist.
- **409 - Conflict**: The request conflicts with another request, perhaps due to using the same idempotent key.
- **429 - Too Many Requests**: Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff for your
  requests.
- **500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors**: Something went wrong on Narvi's end.

## Narvi API Endpoints and Transaction Payload

### API Endpoints

Narvi provides a range of API endpoints to interact with your account and perform transactions. Here are details on
these endpoints:

1. **List Accounts Endpoint**: Retrieve a list of accounts associated with your account.

   ```typescript
   const response = await narvi.accounts.list()
   ```

2. **Retrieve Account Endpoint**: Fetch detailed information about a specific account by providing its unique
   identifier.

   ```typescript
   const response = await narvi.accounts.retrieve(ACCOUNT_ID)
   ```

3. **Retrieve Transaction Endpoint**: Access detailed information about a specific transaction using its unique
   identifier.

   ```typescript
   const response = await narvi.transactions.retrieve(TRANSACTION_ID)
   ```

4. **List Transactions for an Account Endpoint**: Retrieve a list of transactions associated with a specific account.

   ```typescript
   const response = await narvi.transactions.list({ account_pid: ACCOUNT_ID })
   ```

5. **Create Transaction Endpoint**: Initiate a new transaction within the Narvi platform.

   ```typescript
   const response = await narvi.transactions.create(TRANSACTION_PAYLOAD)
   ```

### Transaction Payload

To create a new transaction using the Narvi API, you'll need to provide a payload object with the following structure:

```typescript
interface TransactionPayload {
  account_pid: string; // Unique identifier for the Narvi account
  currency: string; // Currency code, e.g., 'EUR'
  amount: number; // Transaction amount
  recipient: {
    name: string; // Recipient's name
    number: string; // Recipient's bank account number
    bic: string; // Recipient's BIC (Bank Identifier Code)
    country: string; // Recipient's country code, e.g., 'PL'
  };
  remittance_information: {
    ustrd: string; // Unstructured remittance information
    // You can add more fields for structured remittance information if needed
  };
}
```
